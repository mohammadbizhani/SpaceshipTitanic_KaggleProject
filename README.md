# SpaceshipTitanic_KaggleProject
A dataset in which the transport of passengers of a spacecraft to another dimension is checked.


Hello and welcome to this repository. Today, I intend to reach a good score in this dataset with the simplest possible methods without complicating the problem too much.

First, we must get a general understanding of the problem and how different variables are related to each other and to the target of this data.

In this data, we have some numerical and classification data, which we will review and explain each separately.

- PassengerId: The identification code of each passenger seems to be the same in the first part of the code of passengers who have a family relationship, and the second part of their code is different.

- HomePlanet: The planet on which the traveler resides and was born.

- CryoSleep: A variable that shows whether the passenger went to artificial sleep during this space travel or not.

- Cabin: The deck and number and side of each passenger in which he/she resides.

- Destination: The final destination of every passenger.

- Age: The age of each passenger (it was really difficult to explain this variable:)) )

- VIP: Whether the ticket and travel of this passenger has VIP status or not.

- RoomService/FoodCourt/ShoppingMall/Spa/VRDeck: The amount of expenses made by each passenger in these sections on the ship.

- Name: Explaining this variable also is very time-consuming and difficult. :))

- Transported: Whether the traveler has been transported to another dimension or not.





After that i tried to visualized important data, so i can use and chose important and relevant features for our model.
After dropping unrelevante features, dealing with missing values and creating dummy variables; It's time to split the data to train and test.
Now, we can train our model and then predict the test data.

I hope this code can help you to get good scores in this Data Set.
